A Dynamic Molar Mass Calculator. Powered by the [molarmass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/molarmass) NPM library, this application will provide live molar mass updates as a chemical formula is entered.

This was a passion project that I created during a time when I was a private chemistry tutor and wanted to quickly derive the molar mass of obscure compounds
